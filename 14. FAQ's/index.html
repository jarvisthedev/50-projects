                  Capsule makes it easy to create stylized video content with
                  the people who matter most to you, whether that’s employees,
                  customers, students, fans, friends, or however you define
                  community. Just create an account, set up your Capsule, and
                  invite as many people as you want to record videos!

                  Any additional hosted videos beyond your plan's video limit
                  during the monthly billing period will incur overage costs at
                  the per video cost listed above. These overage charges will
                  appear on your next month's bill. If you are on an annual
                  plan, you will receive a monthly bill exclusively for the
                  overage charges. To keep your hosted videos within your plan's
                  limit, you can always delete videos before you reach your
                  maximum amount.

                  You may cancel your Capsule subscription at any time from your
